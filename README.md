# Executor

This is just a simple library for executing a closure on multiple threads at once and being notified when those jobs are complete.

It is modeled very loosely on the [Java ExecutorService](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html) and related classes.
